         * based on this setting.
         *
         * Both PDFLib & CPDF rendering backends provide sufficient rendering
         * capabilities for dompdf, however additional features (e.g. object,
         * image and font support, etc.) differ between backends.  Please see
         * {@link PDFLib_Adapter} for more information on the PDFLib backend
         * and {@link CPDF_Adapter} and lib/class.pdf.php for more information
         * on CPDF.  Also see the documentation for each backend at the links
         * below.
         *
         * The GD rendering backend is a little different than PDFLib and

         * not make any sense when creating image files.  For example,
         * multiple pages are not supported, nor are PDF 'objects'.  Have a
         * look at {@link GD_Adapter} for more information.  GD support is new
         * and experimental, so use it at your own risk.

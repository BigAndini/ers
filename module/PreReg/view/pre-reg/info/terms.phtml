Participants attend by choice, on their own risk; they take the responsibility for their own health status and pay attention to it. We especially point out that the Convention is a sports event where professional jugglers and acrobats will train together with non - professionals of all skill levels. There will be workshops in all sorts of circus disciplines open (but maybe not appropriate!) for everyone; above that props and apparatus will be accessible, be it because the host provides them or any participant simply puts them up and let others use them as well. It is your ownÂ responsibility and neither the hosts\', nor the workshop leaders\', their representatives\' or assistants\' to make sure at any time that your health and fitness condition is adequate to take part in the workshop in question or to use props and apparatus mentioned hereinabove safely.'); ?></p>

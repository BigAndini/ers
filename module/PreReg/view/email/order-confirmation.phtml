        <p><strong>Note:</strong> To receive the email with your eTickets correctly, it is important that you add the email address prereg@eja.net to your address book.</p>
        <p>Thank you for registering for the <?php echo $ejc_with_number; ?>! Your registration helps us to improve <?php echo $ejc_with_year; ?> for you and for all fellow jugglers.</p>
        <p>You chose <?php echo $order->getPaymentType()->getName(); ?> as payment method.</p>

            <p>To complete your order, we need to receive your bank transfer 
                within 14 days. If you ordered a discounted ticket (phase 1 or 
                phase 2), please make sure that your payment is processed within 
                14 days after the end of this phase (i.e. 14th of May / 14th of July).</p>
            <?php echo $this->partial('partial/banktransfer-info.phtml', array('order' => $order)); ?>
            <p>Make sure to state your order ID <strong><?php echo $order->getCode()->getValue(); ?></strong> as the reference for the transfer. Otherwise we won't be able to match your payment and your order can't be processed.</p>
            <p>To see if we have already received your payment, you can visit the following link:
            <a href="<?php echo $this->url('order', array(

        <?php elseif($paymenttype->getType() == 'Cheque'): ?>
            <p>The conversation rate Euro to Pounds for cheques is set to 0.8 - 
                this means that you need to multiply the price with 0.8, i.e. 
                120 EUR --> 96 GBP. We know that this exchange rate is more 
                expensive than market price - if you have an alternative payment 
                method (e.g. credit card, or friends in other countries) we 
                suggest to request a change of payment type for this order with 
                email to <a href="mailto:prereg@eja.net">prereg@eja.net</a>.</p>
            <p>​​Please make cheques payable to: <strong>European Juggling 
                Association</strong>.</p>
